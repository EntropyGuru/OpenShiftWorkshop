# OpenShift Origin Deployment Template

## OpenShift Origin 3.9 with Username / Password

To view all the default templates, please select from the openshift project.

This template deploys OpenShift Origin with basic username / password for authentication to OpenShift. This uses CentOS and includes the following resources:

## Prerequisites

### Generate SSH Keys

You'll need to generate a pair of SSH keys in order to provision this template. Ensure that you do **NOT** include a passphrase with the private key.

If you are using a Windows computer, you can download puttygen.exe. You will need to export to OpenSSH (from Conversions menu) to get a valid Private Key for use in the Template.

From a Linux or Mac, you can just use the ssh-keygen command. Once you are finished deploying the cluster, you can always generate new keys that uses a passphrase and replace the original ones used during inital deployment.

### Create Key Vault to store SSH Private Key

You will need to create a Key Vault to store your SSH Private Key that will then be used as part of the deployment.

**Create Key Vault using Azure CLI 2.0**<br/>
  a.  Create new Resource Group: az group create -n \<name\> -l \<location\><br/>
         Ex: `az group create -n ResourceGroupName -l 'North Europe'`<br/>
  b.  Create Key Vault: az keyvault create -n \<vault-name\> -g \<resource-group\> -l \<location\> --enabled-for-template-deployment true<br/>
         Ex: `az keyvault create -n KeyVaultName -g ResourceGroupName -l 'North Europe' --enabled-for-template-deployment true`<br/>
  c.  Create Secret: az keyvault secret set --vault-name \<vault-name\> -n \<secret-name\> --file \<private-key-file-name\><br/>
         Ex: `az keyvault secret set --vault-name KeyVaultName -n SecretName --file ~/.ssh/id_rsa`<br/>

### Generate Azure Active Directory (AAD) Service Principal

To configure Azure as the Cloud Provider for OpenShift Container Platform, you will need to create an Azure Active Directory Service Principal.  The easiest way to perform this task is via the Azure CLI.  Below are the steps for doing this.

Assigning permissions to the entire Subscription is the easiest method but does give the Service Principal permissions to all resources in the Subscription.  Assigning permissions to only the Resource Group is the most secure as the Service Principal is restricted to only that one Resource Group. 
   
**Azure CLI 2.0**

**Create Service Principal and assign permissions to Subscription**<br/>
az ad sp create-for-rbac -n \<friendly name\> --password \<password\> --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/\<subscription_id\><br/>
      Ex: `az ad sp create-for-rbac -n openshiftcloudprovider --password Pass@word1 --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/555a123b-1234-5ccc-defgh-6789abcdef01`<br/>

You will get an output similar to:

```javascript
{
  "appId": "2c8c6a58-44ac-452e-95d8-a790f6ade583",
  "displayName": "openshiftcloudprovider",
  "name": "http://openshiftcloudprovider",
  "password": "Pass@word1",
  "tenant": "12a345bc-1234-dddd-12ab-34cdef56ab78"
}
```

The appId is used for the aadClientId parameter.

`_artifactsLocation`| The base URL where artifacts required by this template are located. If you are using your own fork of the repo and want the deployment to pick up artifacts from your fork, update this value appropriately (user and branch), for example, change from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/openshift-origin/master/` to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YourUser/openshift-origin/YourBranch/`
`masterVmSize`| Size of the Master VM. Select from one of the allowed VM sizes listed in the azuredeploy.json file ||

## Deploy Template

<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2Fopenshift-origin%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/></a>

Once you have collected all of the prerequisites for the template, you can deploy the template by populating the *azuredeploy.parameters.local.json* file and executing Resource Manager deployment commands with PowerShell or the CLI.

For Azure CLI 2.0, sample commands:

```bash
az group create --name OpenShiftTestRG --location northeurope
```
while in the folder where your local fork resides

```bash
az group deployment create --resource-group OpenShiftTestRG --template-file azuredeploy.json --parameters @azuredeploy.parameters.local.json --no-wait
```

Monitor deployment via CLI or Portal and get the console URL from outputs of successful deployment which will look something like (if using sample parameters file and "North Europe" location):

`https://me-master1.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/console`

The cluster will use self-signed certificates. Accept the warning and proceed to the login page.

If you chose to deploy metrics and / or logging, make sure you select an appropriate VM size (i.e. the Standard_DS2_v2 is too small).  Also, the deployment will take longer as extra time is needed for the additional playbooks to run.

### NOTE

The OpenShift Ansible playbook does take a while to run when using VMs backed by Standard Storage. VMs backed by Premium Storage are faster. If you want Premimum Storage, select a DS or GS series VM.
<hr />
Be sure to follow the OpenShift instructions to create the necessary DNS entry for the OpenShift Router for access to applications.

## Post-Deployment Operations

### Additional OpenShift Configuration Options

You can configure additional settings per the official [OpenShift Origin Documentation](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/welcome/index.html).

Few options you have

1. Deployment Output
  a. openshiftConsoleUrl the openshift console url<br/>
  b. openshiftMasterSsh  ssh command for master node<br/>
  c. openshiftNodeLoadBalancerFQDN node load balancer<br/>
2. Get the deployment output data
  a. portal.azure.com -> choose 'Resource groups' select your group select 'Deployments' and there the deployment 'Microsoft.Template'. As output from the deployment it contains information about the openshift console url, ssh command and load balancer url.<br/>
  b. With the Azure CLI : 
    ```bash
    az group deployment list -g <resource group name>
    ```
3. Add additional users. you can find much detail about this in the openshift.org documentation under 'Cluster Administration' and 'Managing Users'. This installation uses htpasswd as the identity provider. To add more users, ssh in to each master node and execute following command:
   ```sh
   sudo htpasswd /etc/origin/master/htpasswd user1
   ```
  now this user can login with the 'oc' CLI tool or the openshift console url
